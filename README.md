# WeatherX_next_app


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Future Aspects & Goals




Here's following:
* **User Experience:** Focus on creating a simple and user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate. Ensure that the information is presented in a clear and concise way.
* **Accurate Data:** Your app's weather information should be accurate and up-to-date. You can use reliable data sources and incorporate advanced weather forecasting technologies to ensure the highest level of accuracy.
*  **Customization:**  Allow users to customize the app according to their preferences. For instance, they can set the default temperature unit (Fahrenheit or Celsius) or choose to receive weather alerts for specific locations.
* **Interactive Map:** Include an interactive map that allows users to explore weather conditions in different locations. You can also add features such as overlays and weather radar to provide more detailed information.
* and many more....

Of course, no sites will serve all your needs. So we'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking the repo and creating a small pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to this site..
